```{r setup, include=FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE,

                      warning = FALSE)

# What is R Markdown?

It is an authoring framework for data-based projects. R Markdown is also referred to as “RMD”. It is used to connect the data and generate reports. RMD is a simple plain text file with three types of content:

  + YAML metadata to guide the RMD process
  + Code Chunks to run
  + Text to display


# R Markdown View

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width = 20, fig.height = 20, fig.align='center'}


knitr::include_graphics(path = "G:/TA/image/RMD.png")

```

RMD can be used in the R Interactive Development Environment (IDE) for productive notebook interface. RMD files are stored as “.RMD” . To build a report from the RMD file, “knit” function can be used to render a report. RMD renders the report in familiar formats running the code and embedding the results in the finished document. RMD builds many familiar formats, such as:

- HTML
- PDF
- Word Doc
- Slide Show
- Dashboards & many more…

In every case RMD remains as a reproducible record of work easy to track in version control system like Git and easy to deploy in future.
