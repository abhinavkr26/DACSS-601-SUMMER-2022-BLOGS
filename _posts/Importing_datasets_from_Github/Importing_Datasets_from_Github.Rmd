## What is Github?

At a high level, GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code. To understand exactly what GitHub is, you need to know two connected principles:
- Version control
- Git

#### What is Version Control?

Version control helps developers track and manage changes to a software projectâ€™s code. As a software project grows, version control becomes essential. Version control lets developers safely work through branching and merging. With branching, you can duplicate part of the source code (called the **repository**) and then safely make changes to that part of the code without affecting the rest of the project. Then, once you get your part of the code working properly, you can merge that code back into the main source code to make it official. All of these changes are then tracked and can be reverted if need be.



#### What is Git?

Git is a specific open-source version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. Specifically, Git is a distributed version control system, which means that the entire codebase and history is available on your computer, which allows for easy branching and merging. Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration.


Now that we understand what is Git and Github, we can use it as a repository to host data sets and directly import data sets from there to `RStudio` for executing the projects.


## How to import datasets from Github?

For the purpose of the DACSS 601 course work, all the relevant datasets for classwork have been hosted in Github in the repo `DACSS-601-SUMMER-2022-BLOGS`. This repo has a file `datasets` with two sub files:



```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width = 20, fig.height = 20, fig.align='center'}


#knitr::include_graphics(path = "E:/DACSS-601-SUMMER-2022-BLOGS/image/gitrepoaddress.png")




```

This repo has a file `datasets` with two sub-files:
  - `Advanced_Uncleaned Datasets`
  - `basic Datasets`
  
You can use any of the sub-files to access the data sets. There are different types of data sets available with various difficulty levels. Please chose a data set with your level of comfort and import the same to R Studio to Github. 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width = 20, fig.height = 20, fig.align='center'}


#knitr::include_graphics(path = "E:/DACSS-601-SUMMER-2022-BLOGS/image/gitrepodatasetsubfile.png")

```

So let us import a data set from `basic datasets` sub-file. 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width = 20, fig.height = 20, fig.align='center'}


#knitr::include_graphics(path = "E:/DACSS-601-SUMMER-2022-BLOGS/image/gitreposubfilebasicdatasets.png")

```

Let us now import `poultry_tidy.csv` to RStudio. In order to import the data set from Github repo, we should be careful of importing it from `RAW`content only. To access the `RAW` content data, you need to select the concerned data set by `clicking` on it first. That will take you to the data set page in Github.


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width = 20, fig.height = 20, fig.align='center'}


#knitr::include_graphics(path = "E:/DACSS-601-SUMMER-2022-BLOGS/image/gitreposubfilebasicdatasetsrawcontentlink.png")

```

Now, select the `RAW` tab highlighted in the above image to access the raw content data else the data will always default to `html` type and will not get imported properly in RStudio. 


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width = 20, fig.height = 20, fig.align='center'}


#knitr::include_graphics(path = "E:/DACSS-601-SUMMER-2022-BLOGS/image/gitreposubfilebasicdatasetsrawcontentdata.png")

```

You can now copy the `url` and use it to import the data set as shown in the code chunk below:

```{r}
# invoke package readr
library(readr)

#import poultry dataset
poultry <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhinavkr26/DACSS-601-SUMMER-2022-BLOGS/main/datasets/basic%20datasets/poultry_tidy.csv")

head(poultry)



```

Now, here we can observe that we have directly imported the dataset from Github without downloading or cloning the repository locally in our system. This is critical skill in our toolset as we may not always be able to download or clone repositiores in our local system. Also, it takes substantial space in our local system. However, if there is a need to download or clone the datasets then it can be done easily and then the datasets can easily be imported to R Studio from the local system itself. We will cover that in the next blog.

Now, please do try to import the other datasets from the datasets repository on your own to practice. For any errors that you are unable to resolve, please reach out to the course teaching assistanct or the faculty. Although, it is highly recomended that you look for the solution to the error online on platforms such as `Stack Overflow` for a better understanding and mitigate such issues in future on your own.
